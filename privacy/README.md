Brief summary:
The first large-scale studies of three advanced web tracking mechanisms - canvas fingerprinting, 
evercookies and use of "cookie syncing" in conjunction with evercookies. These tracking 
mechanisms misuse browser features to circumvent users' tracking preferences. There exist subtle 
pitfalls in defensive techniques used by privacy-aware users in which a single lapse in judgement 
can shatter privacy defenses.
