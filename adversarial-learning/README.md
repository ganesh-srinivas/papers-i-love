Feature squeezing reduces the search space available to an adversary by coalescing samples that correspond to many different feature vectors in the origin space into a single sample. By comparing a DNN model's prediction to the original input with that on the squeezed input, feature squeezing detects adversarial examples with high accuracy and few false positives. This paper explores two instances of feature squeezing: reducing the color bit depth of each pixel and smoothing using a spatial filter.
